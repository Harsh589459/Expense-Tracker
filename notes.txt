Files could be images -> images,words,

How to store the Files
1.Storing in the server - Wrong way
    --file has been stored in the harddisk
    -whenever you nedd the file you can simiply read or send it from your server

When your app starts scaling (number of users have increased)
--4gp ram , server would start slowing down

To overcome this problem
1. Vertical scaling -- 8gb ram >>16gb  ram >>32 gb ram

2.Horizontal scaling -> 2 Servers 8 Gb Ram each
    server 1 -> 
    server 2 ->               store the files in DFS -> (any server can access it)
    server 3 ->

    never store files in server store it in DFS 






<------------------------AWS S3(DFS)---------------------------------->

AWS S3 ->Storing Files

-99.99 availability
-any server can access the files inside s3 if permission are granted
-hosting files
-Versioning

AWS 
-Admin Account - root(read,write,delete,update)(CTO,senior manager)
- IAM roles->restrict the user to product 1


<----------------------what does it takes to upload to s3 via code------------------------------------------->

-Make an IAM user who atleast has s3access- s3bot

In your code 
  --go ahead and upload this file -> .csv, .txt , .mov, .jpeg
  --which bucket you have to put this file
  --IAM User ->username (accesskey id) and password  (secret key)
  --make the file url: public

  response{
    location:https://expensetracker123.s3.amazonaws.com/familyphoto.pn
  }
  error{
    log the error
    send a response back to frontend failed (500);

  }
