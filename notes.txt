Files could be images -> images,words,

How to store the Files
1.Storing in the server - Wrong way
    --file has been stored in the harddisk
    -whenever you nedd the file you can simiply read or send it from your server

When your app starts scaling (number of users have increased)
--4gp ram , server would start slowing down

To overcome this problem
1. Vertical scaling -- 8gb ram >>16gb  ram >>32 gb ram

2.Horizontal scaling -> 2 Servers 8 Gb Ram each
    server 1 -> 
    server 2 ->               store the files in DFS -> (any server can access it)
    server 3 ->

    never store files in server store it in DFS
